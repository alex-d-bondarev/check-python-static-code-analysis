# check-python-static-code-analysis
Check if different code analysis tools can detect ugly code in Python

Example code is working, but is not very readable. 
I am looking for a tool or set of tools that will show me:
* how unreadable the code is
* some kind of code readability score that can be used in CI to block PRs
* what parts of the code need refactoring
* refactoring suggestions
